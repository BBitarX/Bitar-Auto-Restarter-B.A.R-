# Bitar-Auto-Restarter-B.A.R-
Automatically restarts an app, made speifically for game servers that sometimes crash. all you need to do is select server.exe and press initiate.


#Note
if you dont know how to use this, you probably wont need it anyway. This app is shitty and I half-assed it, didnt take much time at all. It works but there's a bug where the restarter freezes (but keeps restarting apps) likely due to the thread.sleep, fix that one your own. Minimal functionalities work, and it's alright ig. Logs crash times into crashlogs.txt
